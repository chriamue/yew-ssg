The domain model shows the key concepts in Yew-SSG and their relationships:

* The Static Site Generator is the core component
* Generators produce HTML content based on metadata
* Processors transform HTML templates
* Templates define the page structure with placeholders
* Routes represent application paths with associated components
* Metadata provides information for SEO and templating
* Output is the static HTML files produced by the generation process

=== Generator-Processor Pattern

Yew-SSG uses a two-stage approach to content generation and processing:

1. *Generators* create HTML content for specific purposes:
   * They follow the "Generate" trait
   * They have access to metadata, route information, and content
   * They produce HTML fragments for specific keys (e.g., "title", "meta_tags")
   * They can support multiple output keys

2. *Processors* transform HTML:
   * They follow the "Processor" trait
   * They take HTML and transform it according to their rules
   * They can access metadata and generator outputs
   * They run in sequence, each taking the output of the previous processor

This separation allows for:
* Clear responsibility boundaries
* Extensibility through custom generators and processors
* Pipeline-style processing with composition
* Reuse of components across different applications

=== Template Variable Substitution

Template variables use the `{{variable}}` syntax:

* Variables can reference metadata keys or generator outputs
* Generators have priority over metadata when both exist
* The TemplateVariableProcessor handles the substitution
* Variables can be used in HTML templates and attribute values

Example:
```html
<title>{{title}}</title>
<meta name="description" content="{{description}}">
```

=== Attribute-Based Templating

Data attributes provide a powerful way to template HTML:

* `data-ssg="key"` - Replace element content
* `data-ssg-attr="key"` - Replace attribute value
* `data-ssg-placeholder="key"` - Replace entire element

This approach:
* Keeps templates clean and semantic
* Allows for HTML inspection tools to work properly
* Makes templates more maintainable
* Enables complex replacements like blocks of meta tags

Example:
```html
<div data-ssg-placeholder="meta_tags">
  <!-- Will be replaced with generated meta tags -->
</div>
```

=== Build Process Integration

Yew-SSG integrates into the build process:

* A separate binary target uses the library
* It runs during the build phase, not at runtime
* It pre-renders all routes defined in the router
* It generates static HTML files in the output directory
* The output can be deployed to any static file server

This approach provides:
* Clean separation of concerns
* No runtime overhead for end users
* Simple deployment to any hosting solution
* Compatibility with CI/CD pipelines
