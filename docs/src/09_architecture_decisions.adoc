== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 1: Trait-Based Architecture for Extensibility

*Context:*

The system needs to be extensible to support various HTML generation and processing needs across different projects.

*Decision:*

Use Rust's trait system to define clear interfaces for generators and processors, allowing for custom implementations.

*Consequences:*

* *Positive:* Users can easily extend the system with custom generators and processors
* *Positive:* Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
* *Positive:* Types can implement multiple traits for different capabilities
* *Negative:* Slightly more complex than a function-based approach
* *Negative:* Requires understanding of Rust's trait system

=== ADR 2: Generator/Processor Separation

*Context:*

The system needs to both generate content and process HTML, which are distinct concerns.

*Decision:*

Separate content generation (Generators) from HTML transformation (Processors) with different traits and execution phases.

*Consequences:*

* *Positive:* Clear separation of concerns
* *Positive:* Generators can focus on specific content types
* *Positive:* Processors can transform HTML in a pipeline
* *Positive:* Better testability for individual components
* *Negative:* Requires coordination between the two systems

=== ADR 3: Attribute-Based Templating

*Context:*

HTML templates need a way to include dynamic content without sacrificing validity and readability.

*Decision:*

Use HTML data attributes (`data-ssg-*`) for templating directives.

*Consequences:*

* *Positive:* Templates remain valid HTML
* *Positive:* Templates are inspectable with standard HTML tools
* *Positive:* Approach is intuitive for web developers
* *Positive:* Flexible replacement strategies (content, attributes, placeholders)
* *Negative:* Slightly more verbose than some alternative syntaxes

=== ADR 4: Metadata-Driven Generation

*Context:*

Different routes need different SEO content and page information.

*Decision:*

Use a metadata system with global and route-specific options to drive content generation.

*Consequences:*

* *Positive:* Centralized configuration of SEO information
* *Positive:* Ability to override global settings for specific routes
* *Positive:* Consistent handling of metadata across generators
* *Negative:* Requires careful management of metadata hierarchy

=== ADR 5: Builder Pattern for Configuration

*Context:*

The system has many configuration options that need to be set up in a clear, fluent manner.

*Decision:*

Use the Builder pattern for configuration with sensible defaults.

*Consequences:*

* *Positive:* Fluent, readable API for configuration
* *Positive:* Clear defaults with the ability to override
* *Positive:* Future extensibility without breaking changes
* *Negative:* Slightly more code than direct struct initialization
