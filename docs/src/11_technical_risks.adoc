== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Identified Risks

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,1,2"]
|===
|ID |Risk |Description |Impact (1-5) |Mitigation
|R-1 |Yew Version Compatibility |Changes in Yew's SSR implementation could break compatibility |4 |Implement comprehensive test suite with version matrix; maintain compatibility layer
|R-2 |HTML Processing Performance |Complex HTML processing could slow down the build process for large sites |3 |Benchmark and optimize HTML transformations; consider parallel processing for independent routes
|R-3 |Template Flexibility Limitations |The template system may not handle all complex layout requirements |2 |Document clear examples of limitations; provide escape hatches for custom processing
|R-4 |Server-Side Routing Complexity |Different routing strategies in Yew applications may be difficult to support universally |3 |Support common patterns out of the box; provide extension points for custom routing logic
|R-5 |Development/Production Parity |Differences between development and production environments could lead to unexpected behavior |2 |Provide tools to test generated output in development; document common issues

=== Technical Debt

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
|ID |Debt |Description |Severity (1-5)
|D-1 |Error Handling Consistency |Error handling could be more consistent across the codebase with better error types |2
|D-2 |CSS/Asset Processing |The library doesn't handle CSS or other assets, leaving this to the developer |3
|D-3 |Minimal Testing of Edge Cases |Some complex edge cases in HTML processing could have more test coverage |2
|D-4 |Documentation Improvements |API documentation could be enhanced with more examples and use cases |2
|D-5 |Client Rehydration |The current approach requires manual coordination of client-side rehydration |3

=== Risk Monitoring and Mitigation Plan

==== R-1: Yew Version Compatibility

*Monitoring*:
* Track Yew releases and migration guides
* Run automated tests against multiple Yew versions
* Monitor community issues related to SSR changes

*Mitigation Actions*:
* Create version-specific compatibility modules
* Document version requirements clearly
* Maintain close alignment with Yew development

==== R-2: HTML Processing Performance

*Monitoring*:
* Benchmark generation times for different site sizes
* Profile HTML processing bottlenecks

*Mitigation Actions*:
* Optimize critical processing paths
* Implement caching where appropriate
* Consider parallel processing for independent routes
* Provide configuration options to disable expensive processors
