*Motivation:*

Yew-SSG is deployed as a Rust library that is integrated into a Yew application's build process. It generates static HTML files that can be deployed to any web server capable of serving static files.

*Quality and/or Performance Features:*

* The static site generation happens during the build process, not at runtime
* Generated static files can be deployed to any standard web hosting solution
* No special server requirements beyond serving static files
* Built with Rust for performance and safety

*Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure:*

* Yew-SSG library is imported into the Rust project
* A binary target in the project uses Yew-SSG to generate static files
* Generated HTML files are deployed to a web server
* Client-side Yew application takes over after initial page load

==== _Development Environment_

[plantuml, format=svg]

@startuml
node "Rust Project" {
  folder "src" {
    [App Components]
    [Routing]
    [Main.rs]
  }

  folder "ssg" {
    [SSG Binary]
  }

  folder "static" {
    [CSS]
    [Images]
    [JavaScript]
  }

  [Cargo.toml] as Cargo

  Cargo --> [App Components] : defines
  Cargo --> [SSG Binary] : defines
  [SSG Binary] --> [Routing] : uses
  [Main.rs] --> [App Components] : uses
  [Main.rs] --> [Routing] : uses
}

folder "output" {
  folder "dist" {
    [Generated HTML]
    [Copied Static Assets]
  }
}

[SSG Binary] --> [Generated HTML] : creates
[static] --> [Copied Static Assets] : copied to
@enduml
----

*Explanation:*

The development environment consists of:

1. A Rust project with:
   * Application components in the src directory
   * An SSG binary in the ssg directory
   * Static assets (CSS, images, JavaScript)
   * Cargo.toml for dependencies and configuration

2. During the build process:
   * The SSG binary pre-renders the application to HTML
   * Static assets are copied to the output directory
   * The output is ready for deployment to a web server

==== _Web Server Deployment_

[plantuml, format=svg]
----
@startuml
node "Web Server" {
  [Static File Server]

  folder "document_root" {
    [index.html] as Root

    folder "about" {
      [index.html] as About
    }

    folder "blog" {
      [index.html] as Blog

      folder "post-1" {
        [index.html] as Post1
      }
    }

    folder "assets" {
      [styles.css]
      [app.js]
      [images]
    }
  }

  [Static File Server] --> [document_root] : serves
}

actor "User" as User
actor "Search Engine" as Search

User --> [Static File Server] : requests
Search --> [Static File Server] : indexes
@enduml
----

*Explanation:*

The web server deployment consists of:

1. A static file server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, AWS S3, Netlify)
2. A document root with:
   * An index.html file for the root route
   * Subdirectories for each route, each with an index.html file
   * Assets directory with styles, scripts, and images

3. Users and search engines access the static files, with users getting the full SPA experience after the initial page load.
