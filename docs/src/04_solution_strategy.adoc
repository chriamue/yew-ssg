== Solution Strategy

=== Technology Decisions

* *Rust Language*: Chosen for safety, performance, and compatibility with Yew
* *Yew Framework Integration*: Direct integration with Yew's SSR capabilities
* *Trait-based Architecture*: Using Rust's trait system for extensibility
* *Builder Pattern*: For clean, fluent configuration API
* *Template Processing*: Custom processing with MiniJinja for template rendering
* *HTML Manipulation*: Using lol_html for efficient HTML transformation

=== Architectural Approach

* *Separation of Concerns*: Clear separation between generators, processors, and the core SSG engine
* *Pipeline Architecture*: Content flows through a series of processing steps
* *Extensible Plugin System*: Trait-based system for creating custom generators and processors
* *Sensible Defaults*: Default implementations provide immediate value while allowing customization

=== Quality Strategy

* *SEO Optimization*: Built-in generators for common SEO needs (meta tags, Open Graph, etc.)
* *Performance*: Efficient HTML processing with minimal overhead
* *Extensibility*: Well-defined traits for extending functionality
* *Ease of Use*: Builder pattern and sensible defaults make common cases simple
* *Maintainability*: Clean separation of concerns and comprehensive test coverage

=== Development Strategy

* *Test-Driven Development*: Comprehensive test suite for each component
* *Documentation-First*: Detailed documentation with examples
* *Community Feedback*: Iterative improvement based on real-world usage
